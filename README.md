# Volume2 Windows 11 Skin + Device Name

![Preview Image](Preview.png "Preview Image")

It's a [Volume2](https://github.com/irzyxa/Volume2) OSD skin that is based on default Windows 11 volume control skin but it is 150% bigger and also displays the device name. That's it.

I highly recommend chaning your device names in the Windows System > Sound settings into something simplier such as "Speakers", "Headphones" etc.

## How to Install

Copy the `Windows 11 + Device` directory into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Volume2\Osd Skins` (or wherever you have installed Volume2).
